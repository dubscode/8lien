      Be bold and imaginative! Monsters can have strange or unexpected powers, interesting backstories, and even quirky habits. They can be dangerous, but make sure they're still fun in some wayâ€”whether through their behavior, appearance, or unusual abilities. 
       
      The goal is to create a monster that feels alive and has personality. Avoid duplicating any of the monsters I've listed in 'existingMonsters'. Here's what we're looking for:
       
      - Unique physical traits (number of limbs, skin texture, colors, etc.)
      - Fascinating abilities or quirks (think beyond typical powers)
      - Fun details that make the monster memorable (even if it's dangerous to humans)
      - Playful or interesting behaviors
